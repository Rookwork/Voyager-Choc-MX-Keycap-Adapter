# Choc to MX Keycap Adapter

![Adapter](/_readme-assets/adapter.png)

A small 3D-printable adapter to use MX keycaps on Choc switches. I tried out this [Choc-MX Direct Adapter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4134048) by DodgerX, and I liked it, but I decided to rebuild it and put a little ZSA-Voyager spin on the design. You can use the tips of the paper airplane to help install and remove the adapters.

If you have an MX keycap set you really want to use with the Voyager, now you can! Here are a few examples:

Printed on the Bambu Labs X1C with mostly default, 0.2mm layer height settings. The tolerances are meant to be fairly tight, so I suggest printing a couple of test adapters to make sure the design works with your printer first.

Use tree supports with 0.22mm gap for relatively easy removal.

Enjoy!
